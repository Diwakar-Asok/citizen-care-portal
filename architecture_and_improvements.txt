1.Important Notes:

*)Default development port is set to 3000 for convenience.
*)Favicon üõ°Ô∏è customized to match CitizenCare Portal theme.
*)Local storage is used to save progress so users can resume the form later.
*)AI ‚ÄúHelp Me Write‚Äù feature uses OpenAI API for text suggestions.
*)The UI is fully responsive and follows accessibility best practices.

2.Decisions & Rationale

*)React Hook Form + Yup chosen for robust validation and easy localization.
*)i18next used for full multilingual support (Arabic/English).
*)Tailwind CSS combined with Material UI for flexible yet consistent styling.
*)LocalStorage used to persist progress bar offline, per requirement.
*)Redux Toolkit used for structured state handling (though Context API would be sufficient here).
*)OpenAI API integration demonstrates creative use of AI assistance for user inputs.

3.Known Limitations

*)Validation error messages don‚Äôt dynamically switch to Arabic yet.
*)Unit tests are not included (mocking complexity noted in architecture_and_improvements.txt).
*)AI key included temporarily for code review only.

4.Architecture Summary

Core Concept:
A 3-step application form that captures user data (personal, family, financial) and persists it in local storage using Redux Toolkit.

Structure:

src/features/form/ ‚Äì step components, slice logic.
src/store/ ‚Äì Redux store and types.
src/utils/ ‚Äì validation schemas, helper functions.
src/components/common/ ‚Äì reusable UI (ProgressBar, LanguageSwitcher, AI modal).
src/pages/ApplicationForm.tsx ‚Äì main container managing routes and progress bar.
src/services/formService.ts ‚Äì mock submission API.

Data Flow:
Each step uses React Hook Form ‚Üí saves data to Redux slice ‚Üí combined global progress is tracked ‚Üí final submission mocks an API call.

Internationalization:
react-i18next manages language context. Form validation messages are translated dynamically using i18n.t() inside Yup schemas.

AI Integration:
Step 3 includes an ‚ÄúAI Writing Assistant‚Äù modal that calls generateSuggestion() using OpenAI‚Äôs API for text completion.

5.Decisions & Trade-offs:

| Decision                 | Reason                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| RTK instead of Context   | Faster setup, easier action dispatches, familiar syntax |
| LocalStorage persistence | Required ‚ÄúSave progress locally‚Äù functionality          |
| React Hook Form          | Lightweight and integrates seamlessly with MUI          |
| Tailwind + MUI           | Combines utility speed with consistent UI               |
| Vite + TS                | Fast dev environment and strong typing                  |

6.Improvements & Future Scope

Unit Tests:
Planned with Vitest, but deferred. Setup partially implemented; environment mocks for i18next and jsdom caused delays.
Documented approach and test plan ready for future enhancement.
Context Refactor:
Replace RTK with React Context + useReducer to simplify state sharing.
i18n Enhancements:
Dynamic revalidation and live translation for validation error messages.
UI/UX:
Add animated transitions between steps, skeleton loaders, and accessibility improvements.

7.Summary
This project demonstrates a clean architectural pattern with modular structure, form handling, and modern frontend tooling.  
All design and logic decisions prioritize clarity, maintainability, and alignment with real-world frontend engineering practices.
